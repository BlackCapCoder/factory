# factory game

This is a factory building game that is heavily inspired by shapes.io,
which is in turn inspired by factorio.


My main complaint with the titles mentioned is that they are both
heavily mouse-oriented- this game prides itself on being strictly
keyboard only, and with vi-like controls at that!


My goal is to create a factory building game that is orders of magnitude
more fast-paced than other titles, through shear utility of the control
scheme.


There is nothing to be unlocked or upgraded, and buildings cost nothing.
The only thing holding you back is the speed at which you are able to
communicate to the game what you want to do.
